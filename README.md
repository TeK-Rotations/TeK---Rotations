# TeK---Rotations
TeK GOAT Rogue is a Mythic+–focused Outlaw Rogue rotation built for players who want strong, consistent performance with minimal micromanagement. It intelligently handles single-target, cleave, and AoE, adapting in real time to enemy count, combat state, and talent choices.

The rotation features a smart interrupt system that reacts only when necessary, prioritizing dangerous casts and chaining Kick, Kidney Shot, Blind, Cheap Shot, and Gouge in a layered, human-like way. Interrupts include intentional delays and variability for realism, while supporting target, mouseover, and focus logic without breaking your main target or funnel damage.

For Mythic+ affixes, TeK GOAT Rogue provides damage optimization and survival logic, but Voidbound Emissaries must be manually targeted. Once targeted, the rotation automatically commits full damage and defensives until the emissary is dealt with, then seamlessly resumes normal behavior.

The profile also includes auto-stealth, auto-poisons, pre-pull logic, opener handling, cooldown management, Roll the Bones optimization (including Keep It Rolling logic), and hero talent support for both Fatebound and Trickster. Defensive abilities trigger automatically based on configurable health thresholds to keep you alive without panic buttons.

Everything is movement-safe, configurable, and designed to feel natural—so you can focus on mechanics and positioning while the rotation handles execution.

Built to perform. Built to adapt. Built to stop what matters.


TeK GOAT Elemental is a Mythic+–focused Elemental Shaman rotation built for players who want high damage, clean burst windows, and controlled utility without constant micromanagement. It dynamically handles single-target and AoE, automatically adapting to enemy count, movement, combat state, and talent selections in real time.

The rotation features a fully built-in mouseover interrupt system designed to feel natural and intentional. There’s no auto-tab targeting—you stay locked on your main target for funnel damage. Simply hover a caster’s nameplate and the system prioritizes Wind Shear first, then Capacitor Totem, and optionally Thunderstorm if needed. Interrupts include configurable delay windows to simulate human reaction timing, preventing robotic instant kicks while still reliably stopping dangerous casts.

Damage optimization is handled intelligently. Maelstrom spending adjusts automatically to avoid overcapping while choosing the correct spender—Earth Shock, Earthquake, or Elemental Blast—based on talents and target count. Cooldowns such as Ascendance, Stormkeeper, racials, trinkets, weapon on-use effects, and potions are aligned for proper burst stacking instead of being used randomly.

Movement is fully supported. Spiritwalker’s Grace allows casting on the move, and Ghost Wolf can automatically activate (with a configurable delay) when repositioning is required. Defensive logic includes a customizable Astral Shift health threshold along with automatic Healthstone and potion usage for critical situations.

The profile also maintains weapon enchants, shields, pre-combat setup, and auto-targeting if your current target dies or drops out of range. Everything is configurable, movement-safe, and built to feel smooth in real dungeon environments.

Built to burst. Built to move. Built to interrupt what matters.
