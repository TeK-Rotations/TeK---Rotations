TeK GOAT is a Mythic+ & Raid performance suite built for players who want elite results without micromanaging every global. Designed for high-end dungeon pressure, each profile adapts in real time to enemy count, talents, combat state, cooldown alignment, and movement—delivering clean, consistent output that feels human, not scripted.

TeK GOAT Rogue (Outlaw) drives intelligent single-target, cleave, and AoE while maintaining funnel priority. The interrupt system is layered and realistic—prioritizing dangerous casts and chaining Kick, Kidney Shot, Blind, Cheap Shot, and Gouge with intentional delay windows. It supports target, mouseover, and focus logic without breaking main-target damage. Roll the Bones is fully optimized (including Keep It Rolling logic), cooldowns are stacked correctly, and hero talents for Fatebound and Trickster are fully supported. Voidbound Emissaries are manually targeted by design—once selected, the system commits fully until the threat is eliminated, then flows back into rotation seamlessly.

TeK GOAT Elemental delivers controlled burst and precision utility without auto-tab chaos. Mouseover interrupts prioritize Wind Shear, then Capacitor Totem, then Thunderstorm—while you stay locked on your primary target for maximum funnel value. Maelstrom management prevents overcapping and selects the correct spender automatically. Ascendance, Stormkeeper, racials, trinkets, and potions are properly stacked for real burst windows. Movement is fully supported with Spiritwalker’s Grace and optional Ghost Wolf automation, and defensives trigger intelligently at configurable thresholds.

TeK GOAT Arcane Mage is a fully engineered burst system built for Sunfury and Spellslinger. It auto-detects hero talents, syncs steroid trinkets by duration, and perfectly aligns Arcane Surge with Touch of the Magi for maximum Salvo value. Movement logic keeps damage flowing with Presence of Mind, Orb timing, and smart Barrage dumps—no wasted stacks, no missed windows. Defensives are proactive and reactive with configurable HP thresholds, auto-barrier logic, emergency Ice Cold and Greater Invisibility, plus dangerous-cast detection. Interrupts, spellsteal, curse removal, auto-targeting, and end-of-fight resource dumps are all handled seamlessly.

Movement-safe. Fully configurable. Dungeon-ready.

Built to burst.
