# TeK---Rotations
TeK GOAT Rogue is a Mythic+–focused Outlaw Rogue rotation built for players who want strong, consistent performance with minimal micromanagement. It intelligently handles single-target, cleave, and AoE, adapting in real time to enemy count, combat state, and talent choices.

The rotation features a smart interrupt system that reacts only when necessary, prioritizing dangerous casts and chaining Kick, Kidney Shot, Blind, Cheap Shot, and Gouge in a layered, human-like way. Interrupts include intentional delays and variability for realism, while supporting target, mouseover, and focus logic without breaking your main target or funnel damage.

For Mythic+ affixes, TeK GOAT Rogue provides damage optimization and survival logic, but Voidbound Emissaries must be manually targeted. Once targeted, the rotation automatically commits full damage and defensives until the emissary is dealt with, then seamlessly resumes normal behavior.

The profile also includes auto-stealth, auto-poisons, pre-pull logic, opener handling, cooldown management, Roll the Bones optimization (including Keep It Rolling logic), and hero talent support for both Fatebound and Trickster. Defensive abilities trigger automatically based on configurable health thresholds to keep you alive without panic buttons.

Everything is movement-safe, configurable, and designed to feel natural—so you can focus on mechanics and positioning while the rotation handles execution.

Built to perform. Built to adapt. Built to stop what matters.
